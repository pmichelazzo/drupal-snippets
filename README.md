# Drupal Snippets
Some small Drupal snippets to fix big problems.

Did you know that crazy problem where you spent a lot of time to find a solution? Well... even with more than 20 years working with web development and almost 15 years with Drupal, I have the same problem.

The snippets here can help you, in some ways, to reduce your time looking for a solution for crazy problems, justing copying and pasting the code that you found here (of course, you need to adapt some variables, constants, etc).

Feel free to use in your projects and, if you can, drop a comment here, just to say _"hello, your code help me saving XX minutes/hours/days"_.
